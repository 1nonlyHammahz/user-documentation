The following example shows how to use `MCRouter::set` to set key/value pair to the memcached server. While you cannot `MCRouter::add` the same key twice, you can reset a value for a given key via `set`. It is quite possible to always use `set` instead of `add` since it is generally superset of functionality, but `add` can be good if you explicitly want to catch someone trying to set a key to a different value.
