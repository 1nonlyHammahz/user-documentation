The following example shows how to make a connection not reusable in a connection pool with `AsyncMysqlConnection::setReusable` and test it with `AsyncMysqlConnection::isReusable`. By default, connections in pools are reusable. So, here we create a pool connection that is assigned to `$conn`. When we close `$conn`, that destroys that connection permanently. So when we get `$conn2`, a whole new connection will need to be created since we can't use the connection that was associated to `$conn`.
