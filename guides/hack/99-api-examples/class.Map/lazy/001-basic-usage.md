This example shows you how to use `lazy()` on a rather large `Map` and the time for both a *strict* and *non-strict* version. Since we only need 5 of the elements in the end, the lazy view actually allows us to stop after we meet our required 5 without having to actually filter and allocate all 10000000 elements up front.
