The binary operator `|` performs a bitwise inclusive-OR on its two `int` operands and produces an `int` result. For example:

```Hack
0b101111 | 0b101                      // results in 0b101111
$ucase_letter = 0x41;                 // uppercase letter 'A'
$lcase_letter = $ucase_letter | 0x20; // set the 6th bit to make lowercase 'a'
```
