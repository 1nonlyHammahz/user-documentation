This form of expression creates an anonymous function often referred to as a *closure*, an object that encapsulates the unnamed 
function defined within. A closure is defined like, and behaves like, a named function except that the function has no name.  See 
[anonymous functions](../functions/anonymous-functions.md) for more information and some examples.
