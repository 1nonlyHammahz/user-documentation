A class can provide a set of capabilities&mdash;a *contract*, that is&mdash;by implementing an interface, which is a set of method declarations
and constants.  Note that the methods are only declared, not defined; that is, an interface defines a type consisting of *abstract* methods,
where those methods are implemented by client classes as they see fit. An interface allows unrelated classes to implement the same facilities
with the same names and types without requiring those classes to share a common base class.

Interface types are described in [$$](../classes/implementing-an-interface.md).

See the discussion of [type refinement](type-refinement.md).
