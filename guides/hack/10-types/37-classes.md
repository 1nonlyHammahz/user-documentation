A class is a user-defined type that is used to model an object in the context of object-oriented programming. A class type can
extend (that is, inherit from) other classes, it can implement interfaces, and it can use traits.

Class types are described in [classes](../classes/introduction.md).

See the discussion of [type refinement](type-refinement.md).
