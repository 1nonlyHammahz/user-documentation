# Hack User Documentation

In here contains the user-documentation for Hack specific features. This generally means features that can only be used within the context of a Hack source code file (e.g., `<?hh`) (or in a `<?php` file when you explicitly use `hhvm.force_hh=1` in your configuration). 

Some of these features include `async`, XHP, collections (e.g., `Vector`).
