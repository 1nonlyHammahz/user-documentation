# Hack Tools

In addition to the language itself, Hack provides programmers a wide set of tools for:

* typechecking and inspecting all of your code ([`hh_client`](./02-hhclient.md))
* adding type annotations to your code and type checking one file only ([`hh_server`](./03-hhserver.md))
* migrating PHP code to Hack ([`hackificator`](./04-hackificator.md))
* transpile Hack code to PHP ([`ht2p`](./05-transpiler.md))

By using these tools, you can more easily create new, type-safe Hack code, as well as slowly migrate any existing code to enable the benefits of Hack.
