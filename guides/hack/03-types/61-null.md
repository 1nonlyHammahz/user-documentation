The null type is quite unusual in that it has only one possible value, the null literal `null`. Also, `null` is *never* used explicitly 
as a type name. Instead, it is implied via the use of the `null` literal in the context of a [nullable type](nullable-types.md).

The library function `is_null` indicates if a given value is `null`.
