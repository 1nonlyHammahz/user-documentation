An `if` statement dictates some action when a given condition is true, and optionally when it is false.  For example:

```Hack
if ($count < 0)
    ...
  elseif ($count === 0)
    ...
  elseif ($count < 10)
    ...
  else
    ...
```

If the expression tests `true`, the single statement that follows immediately is executed. Otherwise, if an `elseif` clause is
present the statement immediately following the `elseif` is executed. Otherwise, any other `elseif` expressions are evaluated.
If none of those tests `true`, if an `else` clause is present at the end, the statement immediately following that is executed.
The `elseif` and `else` clauses are optional.

See [compound statements](compound-statements.md) for a discussion about the use of braces around the statement body.

The expression whose value is tested can be arbitrarily complex, involving values and relational, equality, and logical operators,
but it must have type `bool` or be implicitly convertible to that type.  For example:

```Hack
if (($i <= 10 && $j !== 0)) || !getStatus() {
  ...
}
```

An `else` clause is associated with the lexically nearest preceding `if` or `elseif`.  For example:

```Hack
if (...)
  ...
  if (...)
    ...
else  // this else does NOT go with the outer if
  ...

if (...) {    // note the addition of the braces
  ...
  if (...)
    ...
} else      // this else does go with the outer if
  ...
```
