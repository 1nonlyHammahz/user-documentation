The HHVM release cadence tries for every 8 weeks on Fridays. The branch for a particular release is cut on the Monday 11 days prior to that and then rigorously tested. It might be delayed if there are any issues found during testing or if our team is busy with other issues that come up -- this unfortunately happens fairly regularly. Point releases will be done as needed for major bugs.
