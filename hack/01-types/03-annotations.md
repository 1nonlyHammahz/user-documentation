There are three (and only three) places where types can be explicitly annotated in Hack.

# Function and Method Returns

# Function and Method Parameters

# Class Properties

## Abstract final classes

## Abstract class constants

In addition to typing properties with their datatype, you can also declare constants abstract in an abstract class
