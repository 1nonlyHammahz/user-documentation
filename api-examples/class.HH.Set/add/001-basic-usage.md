The following example adds a single value to the `Set` `$s` and also adds multiple values to `$s` through chaining. Since `Set::add()` returns a [shallow copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Shallow_copy) of `$s` itself, you can chain a bunch of `add()` calls together, and that will add all those values to `$s`. Notice that adding a value that already exists in the `Set` has no effect.
