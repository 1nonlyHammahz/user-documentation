The following example adds a single key-value pair to the `Map` `$m` and also adds multiple key-value pairs to `$m` through chaining. Since `Map::add()` returns a [shallow copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Shallow_copy) of `$m` itself, you can chain a bunch of `add()` calls together, and that will add all those values to `$m`.
